#  TODO: Write a file reader that supports the following:
#   (1) something like fileinput, taking command-line files or sys.stdin,
#       BUT supports interactive input via stdin.readline() instead of waiting
#       to collect all of the data
#   (2) seamlessly handle .gz and .bzip2 files
#   (3) simple line parsing?
#       eg. generate tuples
#       maybe just pass in a lineparser function
#
